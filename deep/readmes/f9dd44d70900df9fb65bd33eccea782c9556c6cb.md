![sshepherd — a zero-knowledge shepherd guiding your servers over SSH](docs/assets/hero.jpeg)

Termius, Voltius, and the rest of that category are SSH clients built for a human at the
keyboard. `sshepherd` is the equivalent tool for an AI agent in the driver's seat — a
zero-knowledge SSH ops CLI for **any coding agent** — Claude Code, opencode, Aider, Cursor
CLI, Codex CLI, Cline, or a plain terminal — server health checks, docker/systemd control,
log tailing, config edits, read-only Postgres introspection, and declarative deploys,
without ever letting the agent see a password, private key, hostname, user, or port.

|  | Termius / Voltius | sshepherd |
|---|---|---|
| Who's driving | A human, via a GUI | An agent, via a CLI |
| Output | Terminal panes, raw shell | Typed JSON envelopes, no raw dump |
| Credential model | Human unlocks a vault | Agent never sees a credential, ever |
| Category | SSH/SFTP terminal client | Zero-knowledge ops CLI for agents |

## Why

Two pains motivated this: an agent driving real infrastructure either (a) ends up holding
credentials it has no business seeing — a host, a user, a private key, a password, all
sitting in its context window and its tool-call log — or (b) gets handed raw, messy remote
output (`ssh box 'df -h'`, a wall of `docker logs`) that it then has to parse ad hoc every
single time, with no consistent shape and no guardrails against a destructive command.

`sshepherd`'s answer is a **one-transport core + one-envelope contract**: every op shells
out to the system `ssh` binary through a single execution path (`src/transport.ts`), and
every response comes back as the same typed `Envelope<T>` (`ok`, `alias`, `data`, `error`),
never a raw terminal dump. The agent never types a hostname or password; it types a *name*
— an ssh alias, a Postgres target, a deploy recipe — that resolves entirely outside the
process.

It's a standalone binary — any agent that can shell out to a CLI can drive it, no
integration required beyond that. It also ships as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
skill/plugin for those who use Claude Code specifically (see Install below), but the CLI
itself has no Claude dependency: `ssh`/`devops`/`cli` server operations, safe `postgres`
introspection, declarative `deploy` recipes, and a `security` posture check, all reachable
without the agent ever handling a credential.

## Install

Works with any agent that can shell out to a CLI. Pick a. or b. for any agent/terminal;
c. and d. are for Claude Code specifically.

**a. Prebuilt release binary** — no Bun required at runtime. Grab one from
[Releases](https://github.com/Antheurus/sshepherd/releases) for your platform
(`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`), verify the SHA-256 against the
published checksum, then run it directly:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Antheurus/sshepherd/releases/latest/download/sshepherd-linux-x64
curl -LO https://github.com/Antheurus/sshepherd/releases/latest/download/sshepherd-linux-x64.sha256
sha256sum -c sshepherd-linux-x64.sha256
chmod +x sshepherd-linux-x64
./sshepherd-linux-x64 --version
```

Each release binary also carries a
[GitHub Actions build-provenance attestation](https://github.com/Antheurus/sshepherd/attestations) —
verify it with `gh attestation verify sshepherd-linux-x64 --repo Antheurus/sshepherd`.

**b. Build from source.** Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antheurus/sshepherd.git
cd sshepherd
just build          # -> dist/sshepherd
```

`just build` installs dependencies and compiles the binary. Other targets: `just test`,
`just check` (typecheck + lint), `just smoke` (rebuilds, then runs a live E2E smoke suite
against a disposable local sshd + Postgres fixture — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## The zero-knowledge model

The agent passes only a **name**: an ssh alias (`web-01`), a pg-target name (`prod`),
or a recipe name (`demo`). Every alias/target/recipe is declared once, ahead of time —
`~/.ssh/config`, `~/.config/sshepherd/targets.toml`, or a recipe TOML — never on the
command line and never inside a prompt an agent constructs.

OpenSSH resolves the real connection tuple (`HostName`/`User`/`Port`/`IdentityFile`)
internally; `sshepherd` shells out to the system `ssh` binary (never the `ssh2` npm
library), so credential handling stays entirely inside OpenSSH's own trusted code path.
Every response echoes back only the `alias` it was given — there is no host/user/port/ip
field anywhere in the response type, structurally, not by convention. Database access
follows the same rule: a pg-target resolves to *how* to reach `psql` on a host, never a
database password — `psql` runs inside the target container, authenticated by
peer/trust/`.pgpass` that already lives on the remote.

The `files` group follows the same allowlist-first rule `config` already used: every op
(`ls`/`cat`/`tail`/`download`/`disk-usage`/`upload`) refuses any remote path not
pre-declared per-alias in `~/.config/sshepherd/files-allowlist.toml` — fail-closed, missing
file means every path is refused. `files cat --reveal` layers a second gate on top: each
key must clear a hardcoded, non-overridable secret-pattern denylist (`PASSWORD`, `SECRET`,
`TOKEN`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `CREDENTIAL`, `API_KEY`, ...) and be declared in
`~/.config/sshepherd/reveal-allowlist.toml` — the denylist wins even over a mistaken
allowlist entry.

## Usage

```
sshepherd <group> <action> [positionals...] [--flag value]
```

Nine command groups — `hosts`, `check`, `logs`, `services`, `deploy`, `config`, `db`,
`files`, `security` — 52 ops total. The full command matrix, every op's arguments, output
shapes, and gotchas live in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md), which doubles as the Claude Code
skill definition:

```bash
./dist/sshepherd --help                 # list groups
./dist/sshepherd check --help           # list actions + flags for one group
./dist/sshepherd check overview web-01
```

Output is JSON to stdout by default (add `--pretty` for a human table/key-value view).

A separate `setup` group writes sshepherd's own local config files instead of you
hand-authoring them — `setup ssh-alias register/keygen/install/remove/list/status/update`
for `~/.ssh/config`, `setup db-target` for `targets.toml`, `setup config-allowlist` for
`config-allowlist.toml`, `setup deploy-recipe` for a starter recipe TOML, and `setup
files-allowlist`/`setup reveal-allowlist` for `files-allowlist.toml`/`reveal-allowlist.toml`
(12 actions total). It's not counted in the nine groups above, but every action in it is
agent-invocable — same `--yes` confirm gate as everything else. `setup ssh-alias status` is
the one place outside `setup ssh-alias install` that isn't fully zero-knowledge: it echoes
back the alias's own host/user/port, since the caller already supplied those to `register`
in the first place. The one credential exception is `setup ssh-alias install`: before it
ever asks a human for anything, it tries an already-trusted short-circuit and a
Tailscale-fronted detection, both non-interactive; only if neither applies does it open a
one-shot local browser form, where a human — never the agent — supplies either a password or
a pasted private key. The agent can trigger `install` and wait on it, but never sees, logs,
or relays either credential — see `SKILL.md` gotcha 9.

## What sshepherd NEVER does

- **Never reads `~/.ssh` private keys or any key material.** Authentication happens
  entirely inside the system `ssh` binary and `ssh-agent`; `sshepherd` never opens, parses,
  or transmits a private key, passphrase, or password.
- **Zero outbound network calls except the SSH connections you explicitly request.** No
  telemetry, no phone-home, no analytics, no update checker silently pinging a server.
  Every network call this tool makes is an `ssh`/`scp`-equivalent round trip to an alias
  you declared.
- **No arbitrary remote exec.** There is no `sshepherd exec "<any command>"` escape hatch —
  only a fixed set of curated, read-only or confirm-gated ops, plus named, versioned recipe
  steps for deploys. A raw shell command can only run as an authored step inside a recipe
  TOML file you wrote and control, never as free text typed by an agent mid-session.
- **Never writes a host, user, port, or IP into any output, log, or audit line.** Every
  response echoes back only the alias/target/recipe *name* you passed in; the audit log
  (`~/.local/state/sshepherd/audit.jsonl`) records a timestamp, alias, command, and a hash
  of the arguments — never the raw argument values.
- **The only runtime dependency is `node-sql-parser`**, used to give `db query` a local,
  advisory SELECT-only check before anything reaches the network. No other npm package runs
  at runtime — `bun build --compile` ships a single ~60MB binary with nothing to
  `npm install`.

See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the full threat model, including where the
zero-knowledge guarantee's boundary sits (it's OpenSSH's own security, not sshepherd's, that
protects `~/.ssh/config` and the agent) and how mutating ops are gated.

## Call the binary by absolute path

Like most compiled CLIs installed for a single project, `dist/sshepherd` is not placed on
`PATH`. When wiring this up as a tool for any agent — Claude Code, opencode, Aider, or
otherwise — call it by its absolute path (`SKILL.md` does this consistently for the Claude
Code skill); every example in this README uses the bare `sshepherd` name for brevity —
substitute the real path when invoking.

## Development

```bash
just install    # bun install
just build      # compile dist/sshepherd
just test       # bun test (unit tests, no live ssh required)
just check      # typecheck + lint
just smoke      # rebuild + run scripts/smoke.sh against a disposable sshd+postgres fixture
```

`src/registry.ts` is the single source of truth for every op (group, action, args, whether
it mutates); `src/transport.ts` is the one zero-knowledge execution path every op runs
through; `src/cli.ts` parses argv and dispatches. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
for setup, the pre-PR checklist, and where things live.

## Roadmap

sshepherd is under active development. This is a real roadmap, not a wishlist — items move
🔵 Planned → 🟡 In Progress → 🟢 Shipped as they land. Currently at `v0.2.2`.

| Version | Status | Focus | What's in it |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.3 | 🔵 Planned | Multi-Database Foundations | Generalize the `db` group from Postgres-only to a pluggable multi-engine model. MySQL/MariaDB read-only introspection: query (SELECT-only, dialect-aware advisory check), schema browse, table stats — same pattern as `db query` today. |
| v0.4 | 🔵 Planned | Redis Support | Read-only introspection: pattern-scoped key browsing (no `KEYS *`), TTL/type inspection, memory stats, slowlog tail. Dangerous commands (`FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG SET`, ...) hard-blocked at the registry level, not just advisory. |
| v0.5 | 🔵 Planned | MongoDB Support | Read-only introspection: collection stats, guarded find queries, index inspection. |
| v0.6 | 🔵 Planned | Local Web Dashboard | Localhost-only server (`127.0.0.1`, random port + session token), a lightweight Termius-inspired view of the same live health/service/log state the CLI already produces. Both human and agent can *view* session state — the agent stays zero-knowledge, reading only curated endpoints, never a raw live shell. Credentials are typed **only by a human**, via the same one-shot local browser-form pattern `setup ssh-alias install` already uses. The SSH socket is opened only by the local sshepherd process — never proxied, relayed, or exposed beyond localhost. |
| v1.0 | 🔵 Planned | Stable Multi-Engine + Dashboard | Postgres/MySQL/Redis/MongoDB at parity — same envelope shape, same read-only guarantees, same audit trail. Dashboard hardened, threat model reviewed in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md). Registry/envelope contract frozen — semver guarantees begin. |
