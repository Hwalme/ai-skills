Ontoly is a JavaScript- and TypeScript-native software intelligence engine that
turns source code into a deterministic Software Graph.

Developer tools should not have to rediscover the same repository structure over
and over. Ontoly builds one shared semantic representation that agents, MCP
servers, SDK generators, documentation tools, architecture tools, static
analysis, and IDEs can query without repeatedly searching files or rebuilding
partial AST context.

Ontoly builds understanding. It does not answer questions, call language models,
generate embeddings, or make probabilistic guesses.

## Status

Ontoly `v1.0.0` is the first stable release. Current release: `v1.3.3`.

The public contract is frozen, and the repository includes:

- a Software Graph specification
- a deterministic compiler pipeline
- a JavaScript and TypeScript semantic frontend powered by the TypeScript Compiler API
- a query engine
- MCP capabilities
- deterministic Enhancers for artifact generation
- a derived Semantics artifact for feature ownership, intent vocabulary, and concept graphs
- a derived History artifact for ownership, hotspots, co-changes, churn, and drift
- portable Agent Skills
- validation and semantic evaluation infrastructure
- release gates for docs, packaging, skills, examples, and regression checks

## What Ontoly Is

Ontoly is the semantic layer between a software repository and every tool that
needs to understand it.

```text
Repository
  -> Compiler Frontends
  -> Semantic Model
  -> Software Graph
  -> Enhancers
  -> Semantics
  -> Query Engine
  -> MCP, Skills, SDKs, Docs, IDEs, Analysis
```

The Software Graph is the product. Everything else is a consumer, plugin, pass,
or validation layer around it.

## What Ontoly Is Not

- Not a chat interface.
- Not a coding agent.
- Not a copilot.
- Not vector search.
- Not an embeddings pipeline.
- Not hosted SaaS.
- Not a code generator by default.
- Not a replacement for TypeScript, ESLint, or test suites.

AI tools can consume Ontoly through MCP and Skills, but the graph never depends
on AI output. Every LLM-facing use of Ontoly must go through
[LLM Enhancement](docs/llm-enhancement.md) so graph evidence, confidence, and
fallback rules stay explicit.

## Why Software Graphs

Most developer tools redo the same expensive work:

- agents search files
- documentation tools parse symbols
- architecture tools rebuild dependency graphs
- SDK generators infer API shapes
- static analyzers rebuild call and import relationships

Ontoly turns that repeated work into a reusable graph:

- deterministic IDs
- graph-native diagnostics
- explicit provenance
- stable serialization
- query indexes
- semantic concept indexes
- validation reports
- extension metadata

The goal is simple: every tool that needs software understanding should first
ask whether Ontoly already knows.

## Quick Start From Source

Use this path when building from source.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xsarwagya/ontoly.git
cd ontoly
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
```

Build a graph for the included basic example:

```sh
pnpm ontoly build examples/basic
```

Inspect generated artifacts:

```sh
ls examples/basic/ontoly-output
pnpm ontoly inspect src/service.ts --root examples/basic
pnpm ontoly search UserService --root examples/basic
pnpm ontoly impact UserService --root examples/basic
pnpm ontoly stats examples/basic
```

Run the main release gates:

```sh
pnpm check-types
pnpm test
pnpm docs:check-links
pnpm skills:validate
pnpm validate:packages
```

Run the full gate before a release:

```sh
pnpm release:gates
```

## Package Install

The public package names are scoped under `@0xsarwagya`.

Install with:

```sh
pnpm add -D @0xsarwagya/ontoly-cli
pnpm exec ontoly build .
```

In an interactive terminal, `ontoly build` without a path asks which folder to
index. Press Enter for the current directory, paste a relative, absolute, or
`~/` path, or pass the path explicitly:

```sh
pnpm exec ontoly build
pnpm exec ontoly build apps/api
pnpm exec ontoly build --no-prompt
```

If npm is unavailable in your environment, use the source checkout flow above.

## Build Artifacts

`ontoly build <repository>` writes the rich `ontoly-output/` bundle by default:

```text
ontoly-output/
  SoftwareGraph.json
  manifest.json
  coverage.json
  quality.json
  semantic-model.json
  reports/
    architecture.json
    api.json
    dependencies.json
    configuration.json
    frameworks.json
    workspace.json
  nodes/
    all.json
    by-type/
  relationships/
    all.json
    by-type/
  communities/
    communities.json
    community-000.json
  html/
    graph.html
    architecture.html
```

The output bundle is deterministic and intended for humans, agents, websites,
release artifacts, and debugging Ontoly's own understanding.

For the compact cache-style artifact directory, pass `--output .ontoly`:

```sh
ontoly build . --output .ontoly
```

```text
.ontoly/
  SoftwareGraph.json
  diagnostics.json
  indexes.json
  metadata.json
  statistics.json
```

The JSON graph is the canonical serialization format. Binary formats are
intentionally out of scope until the Software Graph specification is stable.

Remote repositories can be compiled directly:

```sh
ontoly build --remote https://github.com/0xsarwagya/ontoly.git
ontoly output --remote git@github.com:0xsarwagya/ontoly.git
```

Remote builds clone into a temporary checkout, write relative output paths into
the directory where you ran Ontoly, and record the git URL in the output
manifest.

## Software Graph

The Software Graph is a versioned JSON model containing:

- repository metadata
- nodes
- edges
- diagnostics
- indexes
- statistics
- provenance
- extension metadata

Core node families include modules, packages, functions, methods, classes,
interfaces, type aliases, enums, routes, controllers, services, providers,
configuration, environment variables, events, and resources.

Core relationship families include `IMPORTS`, `EXPORTS`, `CONTAINS`, `CALLS`,
`DEPENDS_ON`, `USES`, `READS`, `WRITES`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `EXTENDS`, `HANDLES`,
`MOUNTS`, `INJECTS`, `AUTHORIZES`, `REGISTERED_IN`, `PUBLISHES`, and
`SUBSCRIBES`.

Read the canonical spec in [RFC-0001](rfcs/0001-software-graph.md).

## Deterministic IDs

Ontoly assigns stable IDs so graph output can be cached, diffed, tested, and
compared across builds.

Examples:

```text
module:src/auth/service.ts
fn:src/auth/service.ts:login
class:src/auth/user-service.ts:UserService
route:POST:/login
model:User
```

IDs should survive rebuilds whenever the semantic identity survives.

## Compiler Pipeline

The compiler is a deterministic multi-stage pipeline:

```text
Repository Discovery
  -> Frontend Parsing
  -> Symbol Emission
  -> Semantic Model Generation
  -> Relationship Extraction
  -> Graph Construction
  -> Diagnostics
  -> Validation
  -> Indexing
  -> Serialization
```

Compiler frontends emit structured facts. The compiler owns graph construction.
This keeps parser packages small and keeps graph compatibility centralized.

Read the architecture in [RFC-0002](rfcs/0002-compiler-pipeline.md).

## Query Engine

The query engine provides deterministic graph reasoning primitives:

- lookup by ID, name, type, file, and tag
- neighborhood expansion
- graph walks
- dependency traversal
- caller and callee lookup
- path finding
- impact analysis
- filtering
- pattern matching
- index-backed traversal

Read the query design in [RFC-0003](rfcs/0003-query-engine.md).

Example:

```ts
import { buildSoftwareGraph } from "@0xsarwagya/ontoly-compiler";
import { createQueryEngine } from "@0xsarwagya/ontoly-query";

const graph = await buildSoftwareGraph({ root: process.cwd() });
const query = createQueryEngine(graph);

const services = query.services();
const callers = query.callers("fn:src/auth/service.ts:login");
const dependencies = query.dependencies("class:src/auth/user-service.ts:UserService");
```

## CLI

The source checkout exposes the CLI through the root `ontoly` script:

```sh
pnpm ontoly --help
```

## MCP

Ontoly MCP exposes structured capabilities over the Software Graph. Capabilities
validate inputs before execution and return structured diagnostics for missing,
ambiguous, or unsupported requests.

When an LLM consumes Ontoly MCP responses, LLM Enhancement is mandatory. Non-LLM
tools may call MCP directly, but LLM-generated answers must preserve Ontoly
evidence, confidence, and fallback boundaries.

```sh
pnpm ontoly mcp --list
pnpm ontoly mcp
```

Representative capabilities:

- `GraphStatistics`
- `ExplainArchitecture`
- `FindDependencies`
- `ImpactAnalysis`
- `TraceExecution`
- `FindConfigurationUsage`
- `FindAuthenticationFlow`
- `FindFeatureOwner`
- `SemanticContext`

Every capability is deterministic and evidence-backed. Confidence is derived
from graph evidence, not guessed.

See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) and [docs/getting-started/mcp.mdx](docs/getting-started/mcp.mdx).

## Agent Skills

Ontoly ships portable Agent Skills under [skills](skills). Skills teach coding
agents how to use Ontoly before falling back to repository search.

Every official Skill declares `ontoly.enhancement: "LLM Enhancement"`. This is
mandatory for any LLM-capable agent using Ontoly, not an optional label.

Each Skill follows the same workflow:

1. Confirm the installed workflow declares LLM Enhancement.
2. Verify that an Ontoly graph exists.
3. Build one with `ontoly build .` if it is missing.
4. Check graph trust and diagnostics.
5. Use Ontoly MCP capabilities first.
6. Inspect source files only when the graph cannot answer.
7. Cite evidence and confidence in the final response.

Included Skills:

- architecture review
- impact analysis
- codebase onboarding
- request tracing
- dependency analysis
- security review
- configuration analysis
- framework analysis
- documentation
- refactoring
- performance analysis
- dead-code analysis
- migration analysis
- SDK generation

Validate the shipped Skills:

```sh
pnpm skills:validate
pnpm skills:validate-installed
```

Read the public [Agent Skills Catalog](https://ontoly.xyz/docs/skills),
[skills/SKILL_CATALOG.md](skills/SKILL_CATALOG.md), [docs/agent-skills.md](docs/agent-skills.md),
and [docs/skills-validation.md](docs/skills-validation.md).

## Validation Lab

Ontoly includes a permanent validation lab. It measures correctness,
determinism, graph quality, semantic coverage, trust, diagnostics, performance,
and regressions across real repositories and fixtures.

```sh
pnpm validate
pnpm evaluate
pnpm benchmark:performance
```

Validation outputs live under [validation](validation):

- repository registry
- per-repository reports
- semantic leaderboard
- regression baselines
- release gates
- performance reports
- website assets
- badges

Read [docs/validation-lab.md](docs/validation-lab.md) and
[docs/semantic-evaluation-harness.md](docs/semantic-evaluation-harness.md).

## Known Limitations

- JavaScript and TypeScript are supported through one deterministic ECMAScript frontend.
- Some framework analyzers are intentionally partial.
- Binary graph formats are not implemented.
- Hosted SaaS, vector search, and LLM reasoning are non-goals.
- The Software Graph schema is stable as of v1.0.0.
- MCP capabilities only answer from available graph evidence.
- LLM-facing use requires LLM Enhancement; Ontoly itself remains AI-free.
